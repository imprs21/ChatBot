# Bob, The Deep-Learning Chatbot

## About this Project
This repository contains code for building a chatbot using Python and several libraries, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) library NLTK, deep learning library Keras, machine learning library TensorFlow, and web application framework Flask.


## Overview
This chatbot is designed to simulate conversation with human users, using NLP techniques to understand user input and generate appropriate responses. It is built using a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches, and is trained on a dataset of conversational data.
